The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974,
he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar
pattern whatever the scale.
This new project is important to hone miniLibX skills, to 
discover/use the [mathematical notion of complex numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YaYmyfy9Z4) and to take a peek at the
concept of optimization in computer graphics.

List of fractals:
-----
* [Mandelbrot](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_de_Mandelbrot)
* Julia
* Burning ship
* Mandelbar
* Feigenbaum
* and others without generally known name

Interesting features:
-----
* [GPU using](https://habr.com/post/73526/) via OpenCL
* Changeable [polynom powers](https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/24/the-burning-ship-fractal/)
* Psychedelic colors
* Zoom follow the actual mouse position
* Moving with the arrows
* Intro window
